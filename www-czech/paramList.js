Further, when the mixing results from shear turbulence rather than thermal mixing this parameter is not useful for glider flying.

Larger values indicate greater uncertainty/variability and thus better thermalling over local 'hot spots' or small-scale topography not resolved by the model.  But larger values also indicate greater sensitivity to error in the predicted surface temperature, so actual conditions have a greater likelihood of differing from those predicted.  Small values often result from the presence of a stable (inversion) layer capping and limiting thermal growth.

The cloud base height is not predicted, but is expected to be below the BL Top height.  DrJack does not have a lot of faith in this prediction, since the formula used is so simple, and expects its predictions to be very approximate - but other meteorologists have used it and it is better than nothing.  Note: Since The the 'BL Cloud Cover', 'Cumulus Potential', and 'BL Extensive CloudBase' are based upon fundamentally different model predictions -- respectively the predicted maximum moisture in the BL, the predicted surface moisture, and an explicit cloud-water prediction -- they can yield somewhat differing predictions, e.g. the 'Cumulus Potential' can predict puffy cloud formation when the 'BL Cloud Cover' is zero or vice versa."],
